# Minecraft-Tamagotchi
 
An Android Tamagotchi game using the familiar look and feel of Minecraft. The user takes care of various mobs appearing in Minecraft. The user will feed and give love to the pet, clean the environment the pet lives in and watch the pet react to their inputs, as they maintain its health, happiness, and comfort. The user will be able to take care of more than one pet at a time. The pets will grow up from baby to adult. The pet can die if it's not taken care of properly or has gotten too old. The game will be a mobile app with easy controls optimized for using a small touchscreen device.
